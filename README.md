🏦 Bank Loan Analytics Project: End-to-End Financial Insights

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on providing a data-driven analysis of a bank's lending activities. By leveraging SQL for data processing and Power BI/Tableau for visualization, this dashboard monitors critical lending KPIs, assesses portfolio health (Good vs. Bad Loans), and identifies borrower trends to help the bank optimize its lending strategy.

🛠️ Technical Stack
Data Analysis: SQL (PostgreSQL/SQL Server) – used for KPI calculations and data validation.

Visualization: Power BI  – for interactive reporting.

Data Source: Bank_Loan_Data.csv (included in the Data/ folder).

📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The dashboard tracks five primary metrics to monitor financial performance:

Total Loan Applications: 37.1K (Month-to-Date growth of 7.5%)

Total Funded Amount: $425.5M (Month-to-Date growth of 13.2%)

Total Amount Received: $461.7M

Average Interest Rate: 12.1%

Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio: 13.4%

🖥️ Dashboard Breakdowns
1. Summary View (Portfolio Health)
This view classifies loans into Good Loans (86%) and Bad Loans (14%). It allows stakeholders to quickly assess the "Charged Off" rate and the total loss incurred from non-performing assets.

2. Overview View (Trends & Demographics)
Analyzes seasonal trends, geographic distribution, and borrower profiles.

Monthly Trends: Shows steady growth in loan disbursements, peaking in Q4.

Geography: Interactive map identifying high-volume states.

Purpose: Breakdown of loan reasons (Debt Consolidation is the #1 driver).

3. Details View (Granular Data)
A deep-dive table providing specific details for every loan, including sub-grades, employment length, and payment installments.

🔍 Key Insights & Findings
Risk Assessment: 86% of the portfolio is healthy, but the 14% "Bad Loan" rate requires monitoring of specific "Sub-Grades" to reduce future defaults.

Borrower Profile: Borrowers with 10+ years of employment are the largest segment, representing the most stable revenue stream.

Seasonality: A clear upward trend in loan applications toward the end of the year suggests a need for increased liquidity in Q4.

Housing Impact: Most applicants are in Rent or Mortgage categories; very few "Own" their homes outright, which correlates with the DTI average
